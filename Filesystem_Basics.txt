📂 1. Linux Directory Structure
Linux follows a hierarchical tree structure, starting from the root (/) directory.

Directory	Purpose
/	Root of the file system
/home	Home directories for users
/etc	Configuration files
/bin	Essential command binaries (ls, cp, mv)
/usr	User-installed software and libraries
/var	Logs, variable data
/tmp	Temporary files
/dev	Device files
/proc	Virtual filesystem exposing process info

🧭 2. Navigation Commands
🔹 pwd — Print Working Directory
pwd
Shows your current directory path.

🔹 cd — Change Directory
cd /home/kalpana/Documents
cd ~        # to home directory
cd ..       # go up one level
cd -        # go to previous directory
🔹 ls — List Files
ls                # List files
ls -l             # Long listing with permissions
ls -a             # Show hidden files
ls -lh            # Human-readable sizes
📁 3. File & Directory Operations
🔹 mkdir — Make Directory
mkdir my_folder
mkdir -p folder1/folder2  # Create nested folders
🔹 touch — Create Empty File
touch file1.txt
🔹 cp — Copy File
cp file1.txt file2.txt
cp -r dir1/ dir2/        # Copy directories recursively
🔹 mv — Move or Rename
mv file1.txt folder/       # Move to folder
mv file1.txt newname.txt   # Rename file
🔹 rm — Remove File/Directory
rm file.txt
rm -r folder/            # Remove directory recursively
rm -rf folder/           # Force delete (⚠️ Dangerous)
🔐 4. File Types in Linux
Use ls -l to identify file types:

Symbol	Type
-	Regular file
d	Directory
l	Symbolic link
c	Character device
b	Block device

Example:

drwxr-xr-x   → directory
-rw-r--r--   → regular file
lrwxrwxrwx   → symbolic link
✏️ 5. Practical Exercises
Try this in your terminal:

mkdir linux_day1
cd linux_day1
touch file1.txt file2.txt
mkdir dir1 dir2
cp file1.txt dir1/
mv file2.txt file2_renamed.txt
rm file2_renamed.txt
✅ Summary Checklist
 Understand Linux folder structure

 Navigate with cd, pwd, ls

 Create, copy, move, and delete files/directories

 Identify file types via ls -l
