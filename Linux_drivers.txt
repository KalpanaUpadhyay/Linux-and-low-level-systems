In Linux (and UNIX-like systems), device files in /dev represent hardware devices or virtual devices. These are of two main types: character devices and block devices.

ðŸ§± Block Devices vs ðŸ§¾ Character Devices
Feature	Block Device	Character Device
Data transfer	Block by block (fixed-size chunks)	Byte by byte
Buffering	Buffered I/O	Unbuffered or minimal buffering
Access pattern	Random access (can seek)	Sequential or direct
Examples	Hard drives, SSDs, USB drives	Keyboards, mice, serial ports, sound cards
File I/O behavior	Supports filesystem mounting	Usually does not support mounting
Device file prefix	b in ls -l output (e.g. brw-rw----)	c in ls -l output (e.g. crw-rw----)

ðŸ”¤ Examples of Each
ðŸ§± Block Device Examples
/dev/sda â†’ Entire hard drive

/dev/sda1 â†’ First partition on that drive

/dev/nvme0n1 â†’ NVMe SSD

ðŸ§¾ Character Device Examples
/dev/tty â†’ Terminal

/dev/null â†’ Data sink

/dev/random â†’ Random number generator

/dev/autofs â†’ Automount control (your example)

ðŸ“¦ Why This Matters
Block devices are typically used where data needs to be stored and retrieved in large amounts efficiently.

Character devices are used when data is sent or received as a stream (like input from a keyboard or output to a serial port).

ðŸ”§ Under the Hood
Linux uses major and minor numbers to map device files to actual drivers:

Major number: identifies the driver.

Minor number: identifies the specific device handled by that driver.

For example, /dev/sda1 might have a major number of 8 (block device driver for SCSI disks) and a minor number like 1.

In short:
Character device: communicates one character at a time, like a keyboard.

Block device: communicates in blocks (like sectors), suitable for storage devices.
